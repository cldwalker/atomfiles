## Description
This is my atom config which fully reproduces my keybindings and installed packages ðŸŽ‰. My config is
centered around web development workflows and primarily using clojure and vim keybindings. This config is
being used on osx with atom version >= 1.37.0.

## Setup

Make sure you have [atom](https://atom.io/) and apm installed. Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/cldwalker/atomfiles ~/.atom
cd ~/.atom
apm install --packages-file my-packages.txt
```

## Miscellaneous

After having modified your package list in atom, update the list with `apm ls --installed -bare > ~/.atom/my-packages.txt`.
